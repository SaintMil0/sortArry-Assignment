# sortArry-Assignment Please Read
allows the user to input the size of an array and its elements, then sorts the array in descending order and outputs the sorted array.

2. I chose Timsort because it is a reliable hybrid sorting algorithm combining merge and insertion sort. Initially, I considered merge sort, but Timsort is optimized for real-world data, especially when the input is partially sorted, making it an efficient and practical choice.

3. the most challenging part for me was remembering the syntax and making sure all the logical operations were 100% correct and reliable, I added in validation to notify the user what was being inputted which gave me clarity.
